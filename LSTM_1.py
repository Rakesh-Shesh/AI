#We import the necessary libraries, including TensorFlow.
#Define the LSTM model using the Sequential API from TensorFlow. Here, we specify the number of LSTM units, the input shape (timesteps and input dimensions), and a dense layer for the final output.
#Compile the model by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics to track during training.
#Train the model using the fit function, providing the training data (X_train and y_train) and specifying the number of epochs and batch size.
#Evaluate the trained model using the evaluate function, providing the test data (X_test and y_test).
#Finally, make predictions using the trained model on new data (X_test).
